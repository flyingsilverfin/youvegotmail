to send data (TX mode)
	PWR_UP set high
	PRIM_RX set low
	Payload in TX buffer
	Pulse CE high (pull low to go to standby mode I)
	NEVER KEEP IN TX MODE FOR MORE THAN 4 MS
	

Air data rate:
	RF_DR and RF_SETUP registers (MUST ALL BE THE SAME)
	We will be using 1 Mbps
	
	
RF channel:
	set by RF_CH
	Frequency band: F0 = 2400 + RF_CH[Mhz]
	so if it's set to 0, F0 = 2400
	

Address:
	AW register sets 3,4,5 byte address
	
	
	
Pin connections:
	IRQ: active low, I think this is an interrupt...
	CE: active high (like chip select), actives chip in RX or TX mode
	CSN, SCK, MOSI, MISO (SPI)
	
Programming and control:
	All commands are 1 Byte
	Each new command must be started by a high to low on CSN
	The Chip automatically shifts out the 1 Byte STATUS register to the Master, while command is shifted in on MOSI, then the command data may be shifted to Master
	Serial shift to slave: 
		<COMMAND 1 byte, MSb to LSb>
		<DATA n bytes, LSByte to MSByte, MSbit first each byte>
		
	Commands:
	
		read register:		R_REGISTER	 	000AAAAA 	1 to 5LSByte first - these values are returned on MISO after the status byte	AAAAA = 5 bit register location
		write register: 	W_REGISTER		001AAAAA	1 to 5LSByte first - these values are written on MOSI after the command byte	AAAAA = 5 bit register location
			NOTES: Only executable in Standby or power down modes!!!
			
		read from RX FIFO:	R_RX_PAYLOAD 	01100001 	1 to 32LSByte first - values are returned on MISO after the status byte
		write to TX FIFO:	W_TX_PAYLOAD 	10100000	1 to 32LSByte first - values are shifted out on MOSI after command byte
		
		
	Important Registers:
		00	CONFIG byte
			PWR_UP		Bit 1		1: Power UP, 0: Power down
			PRIM_RX		Bit 0		1: PRX (RX), 0: PTX (TX)
			
		03	SETUP_AW byte - set address width
			AW			Bits [1:0]	'01': 3 bytes, '10': 4 bytes, '11': 5 bytes (default)
			
		05	RF_CH byte - set radio channel
			RF_CH		Bits[6:0]	'0000010' default, see above formula
			
		06	RF_SETUP - configure radio
			RF_DR_LOW	Bit 5		see below for use, default 0
			RF_DR_HIGH	Bit 3 		see below for use, default 1
				[RF_DR_LOW, RF_DR_HIGH]: [00] – 1Mbps, [01]– 2Mbps (DEFAULT), [10] – 250kbps 
			
		07	STATUS - status of RX and TX FIFO's and stuff
			{Not sure we have to touch this...}
			{//TODO}
		
		0A 	RX_ADDR_P0 	39:0	0xE7E7E7E7E7
			{Leave as default for now}
		10	TX_ADDR		39:0 	0xE7E7E7E7E7
			{Leave as default right now}
